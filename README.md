# Android Sample app with MVP architecture

Sample project that displays some images from the dribble API.
Demonstrates some cool stuff that you can do with the modern libraries and tooling in Android these days.

As someone said on reddit: "It's not over-engineered, it's just a skyscraper without the skyscraper part, just the foundations :)"

### Newest additions:
* Added test coverage for unit tests in teamcity CI Server
* Added a runtime permission example. Uses the PermissionsDispatcher library. See RuntimePermissionsActivity class.
(https://github.com/permissions-dispatcher/PermissionsDispatcher)
* Restructured dependencies a bit, check build.gradle file and dependencies.gradle file
* Added support for dagger android bindings (dagger v2.11)
* Added auto-factory library the little cousin of auto-value (https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/factory)
into the project to help with dagger assisted injection (this post explains it quite well:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22799407/looking-for-an-example-for-dagger-assisted-injection)
* Added an Espresso test using the OkReplay (https://github.com/airbnb/okreplay) library that records and replays server
responses. See com.example.features.dashboard.view.MainActivityOkReplayEspressoTest for more details.
* Added support for Firebase cloud testing (firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/) through Teamcity! Now every pull request/
nightly build/release build uses the service to run Espresso tests. See JustAnotherAndroidApp_RunEspressoTestsInFirebase.xml
for more details.
* Added support for Burst library (https://github.com/square/burst) for parametrized unit tests (see
com.example.util.StringUtilsTest for more details).
* Added app shortcuts! Static, dynamic, and dynamic used via the https://github.com/MatthiasRobbers/shortbread library! For
details please check bottom of App class, MainActivity @Shortcut declaration and shortcuts.xml file.
* Added 2 more custom lint checks around colors (Check class NonMaterialColorsDetector and DirectMaterialPaletteColorUsageDetector).
* Added a custom lint check for hardcoded colors. (Check class HardcodedColorsDetector)
* Gradle plugin to check APK size and automatically fail the build if the APK size is more than a specific value (check the
build.gradle and gradle.properties file for the configuration and https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-android-apk-size-plugin
for the actual gradle plugin).
* Added support for Teamcity CI scripts committed in VCS! They are written in Kotlin/xml (Check .teamcity folder or read more
at the bottom of this file)
* Added Sherlock into the project so that developers (and QA) can have easy access to exceptions occurring (and share
them) through the app (see App class and the build.gradle file and https://github.com/ajitsing/Sherlock for the project).
* Added Traceur into the project that allows for displaying more useful stacktraces with RxJava 2 (check TraceurTool class
  and the other related classes or https://github.com/T-Spoon/Traceur for the library).
* Added chuck library for seeing network calls right on the phone. See https://github.com/jgilfelt/chuck for the library
and the NetworkModule class for the added interceptor.
* Disabling animations before espresso tests and re-enabling them afterwards! (See grant_animation_permission.gradle and
EspressoTestHelper class)
* Added Butterknife Actions (See ButterknifeActions class)
* Support for mocking parts of your Dagger graph via DaggerMock library (see MainActivityTest class)
* Added constraint layout! (See activity_main.xml)
* Added an RxJava scheduler that informs Espresso via a CountingIdlingResource on when to pause test execution
 and wait for asynchronous tasks to finish (check com.example.util.rx.RxIdlingScheduler)
* Upgraded project to use the new Mosby MVP v3!! Check https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby for more details.
* Added support for RxJavaPlugins class, that allows easy overriding of RxJava 2 schedulers in tests.
See setup method of MainPresenterTest class.
* Added some variations of the quick settings tiles. See https://medium.com/google-developers/quick-settings-tiles-e3c22daf93a8
for information on the feature and the com.example.features.tiles.PassiveTileServiceOnlyToggle class for the
implementation (plus there are some more goodies in the same package)

### Teamcity - Continuous Integration

The project benefits from Teamcity's feature of storing the CI server configuration in Kotlin in a Version Control System. See https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/Kotlin+DSL for more
details. The settings can be found under the .teamcity folder in the project.

##### Build Configurations:

There's 3 build configurations:

* _'Pull requests'_ build configuration, triggered on every Pull Request. Verifies correctness of a Pull Request (usually for the
'develop' branch). QA would fetch the relevant APK from HockeyApp created by this build configuration in order to manually test the
 feature/fix that the Pull Request introduces. This build:
  * Runs all static analysis tools.
  * Runs all unit tests for all build types.
  * Perform method count for all build types.
  * Checks for duplicates.
  * Builds APKs.
  * Runs all espresso tests on Firebase Test Cloud.
  * Uploads APKs to HockeyApp.
  * Updates Github with the status of the job (success/failure).
* _'Nightly Builds_' build configuration, triggered every night at midnight on 'develop' branch.
QA would fetch the relevant APK from HockeyApp created by this build config in order to test the integration of
features of the app. This build is also deployed to a closed alpha playstore group for people to test. This build:
  * Runs all unit tests for all build types.
  * Performs method count for all build types.
  * Checks for duplicates.
  * Builds APKs.
  * Runs all espresso tests on Firebase Test Cloud.
  * Uploads APKs to HockeyApp.
  * Uploads Release APK to private alpha channel in Playstore.
* _'Releases'_ build configuration, triggered on every branch matching the 'release/*' logical branch name.
QA would fetch the relevant APK from HockeyApp to perform the final testing before the release.
This build is also deployed to an open beta playstore group for people to test. This build:
  * Runs all static analysis tools.
  * Runs all unit tests for all build types.
  * Performs method count for all build types.
  * Checks for duplicates.
  * Builds APKs.
  * Runs all espresso tests on Firebase Test Cloud.
  * Uploads APKs to HockeyApp.
  * Uploads Release APK to public beta channel in Playstore.


##### Reports:
There's also all sorts of reports available:

* Checkstyle static analysis report shows all the checkstyle warnings in the project. Would usually report
 back empty as there's a zero tolerance policy in the project. On failed builds it pinpoints the issues
 that need to be fixed.

![2]
* Unit test reports for all build types show all the tests that were run along with additional details
and stacktraces should an error occur. 2 dashboards, one is the Teamcity generated Test report, the
other is the original Junit4 html report.

![3]

![11]
* Dex method counter reports for all build types show the method count for every APK, along with an
interesting drill down visualization that makes it very easy to spot libraries that contain too many
methods. As a note, usually release and QA APKs have a smaller method counts in these reports as
Proguard is running in these build types, stripping unused methods.

![4]
* Findbugs static analysis report shows all the findbugs warnings in the project. Would usually report
back empty as there's a zero tolerance policy in the project. On failed builds it pinpoints the issues
that need to be fixed.

![5]
* Lint static analysis report shows all the lint warnings in the project. Would usually report back
empty as there's a zero tolerance policy in the project. On failed builds it pinpoints the issues
that need to be fixed.

![6]
* PMD static analysis report shows all the PMD warnings in the project. Would usually report back
empty as there's a zero tolerance policy in the project. On failed builds it pinpoints the issues
that need to be fixed.

![7]
* There's no report at the moment for the firebase cloud testing. You'll need to go into the build
log and locate the url that points to the Google Cloud Storage Bucket that the results are saved
in. With a few changes one can use a personal (paid) storage bucket and then pull the test results
back into teamcity. This article briefly touches on the topic:

##### Teamcity Plugins:

A couple of Teamcity plugins were used to make my life easier:
* 'Advanced Shared Build Number': See https://java.nicholaswilliams.net/TeamCityPlugins/download
A plugin that allows you to share build counters across builds. As that counter is part of the
 version code of the APK, it's good to keep them in sync.
* 'Slack Notifications plugin': See https://github.com/PeteGoo/tcSlackBuildNotifier
A plugin that allows you to post Build Statuses to Slack.
* 'Chuck Norris Teamcity Plugin': See https://github.com/dbf256/teamcity-chuck-plugin
Not much to say about this one ;-)

##### Notes:

* Teamcity server is hosted here: http://104.237.3.218:8111 Feel free to login as guest and explore!
* Public beta channel (https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.justanotherandroidapp) can then (in theory)
be distributed across the company. One thing I tried was adding the link to an NFC tag and hanging
that on the wall, so that everyone can quickly fetch the beta app!

##

### HockeyApp

I am using HockeyApp to save and (in theory) distribute the APKs to QA or stakeholders. See https://hockeyapp.net
for more details on the product. This is what it looks like in the HockeyApp dashboard:

![8]

As you can see there's different builds for the different CI build configurations and all the build types.
HockeyApp guys were kind enough to provide me with a free account to demonstrate the usage of their tool.

### Playstore reviews in slack

Using Review bot for this (https://reviewbot.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=athkalia-just-another-android-app)
Not much to say, just a super simple tool that gets the job done.
When a review comes it looks like this:

![13]

### Roadmap
 * App shortcuts
 * Screenshot automation
 * A cool debug drawer
 * Automated performance testing
 * Some examples for deep links
 * Conductor library
 * Some example of runtime permissions
 * Accessibility stuff
 * Android O features

### Submitting PRs
Please make sure the command ```gradlew check``` completes successfully before creating the PR. This command
runs all the tests for all the variants, plus the 4 static analysis tools: lint, checsktyle, pmd, findbugs.


Any feedback/pull request is welcome!
